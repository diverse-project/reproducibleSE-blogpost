# Reproducible Science and Software Engineering - A Blogpost

This is the companion repository of this blogpost : TO LINK

## Material

The content of this repository is organized as follows :

- the directory **definitions** (? grp1) lists the different definitions gathered by the research community. How to define reproducible science? How to differentiate *reproducible*, *replicable* and *repeatable* science? 

- **examples** provides minimal samples of code or experiments illustrating the threats to reproducibility faced by researchers in software engineering. 

- **figures** contains all the additional content, as the figures, pictures and models used in the blogpost

- **tools** (? grp3) highlights different tools at the disposal of researchers in order to publish reproducible science. 
We define and classify different tools ...

- **papers** (? grp4) proposes an analysis of several research papers in the software engineering community. Are their experiment reproducible? How do they manage the reproducibility? We conducted an analysis based on multiple criteria ...
